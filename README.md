## Material UI 
for get the easier way to get CSS and a style
https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/

Why use Material-UI's styling solution?
In previous versions, Material-UI has used LESS, then a custom inline-style solution to write the component styles, but these approaches have proven to be limited. A CSS-in-JS solution overcomes many of those limitations, and unlocks many great features (theme nesting, dynamic styles, self-support, etc.).

Material-UI's styling solution is inspired by many other styling libraries such as styled-components and emotion.

üíÖ You can expect the same advantages as styled-components.
üöÄ It's blazing fast.
üß© It's extensible via a plugin API.
‚ö°Ô∏è It uses JSS at its core ‚Äì a high performance JavaScript to CSS compiler which works at runtime and server-side.
üì¶ Less than 15 KB gzipped; and no bundle size increase if used alongside Material-UI.
