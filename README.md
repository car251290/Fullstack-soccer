## JavaScript 

 (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm

JavaScript functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, taking some form of input and returning an output.

To define a function, you must use the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ( ). Then you have to write the function logic between curly brackets { }
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript
Let's start off by looking at the building blocks of any language: the types. JavaScript programs manipulate values, and those values all belong to a type. JavaScript's types are:

Number
BigInt
String
Boolean
Function
Object
Symbol (new in ES2015)

In the previous step, you used string interpolation to insert one string inside of another. Each interpolation expression that is part of an interpolated string expression can be of any data type, though. Let's include values of various data type expressions in an interpolated string.

Constructor
Date()
When called as a function, returns a string representation of the current date and time. All arguments are ignored. The result is the same as executing new Date().toString().

new Date()
When called as a constructor, returns a new Date object.

## Node.js 

In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.

## API reference documentation
The API reference documentation provides detailed information about a function or object in Node.js. This documentation indicates what arguments a method accepts, the return value of that method, and what errors may be related to that method. It also indicates which methods are available for different versions of Node.js.

This documentation describes the built-in modules provided by Node.js. It does not document modules provided by the community.

## PostMan

Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. Postman simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration so you can create better APIs—faster.

A single source of truth for APIs

Postman provides a cloud-based, version-controlled, centralized repository for all API artifacts throughout the entire API lifecycle. All of the Postman platform's tools use the repository, which ensures a single source of truth for your APIs. The API repository enables teams and organizations to gather metrics and discern insights through the built-in intelligence capabilities on the platform. Postman's desktop and web applications connect to the API repository through workspaces for personal, team, or public use.

You can also connect your API repository to the other products and tools you use through Postman's pre-built integrations.

## MongeDB as the server 

MongoDB’s document data model naturally supports JSON and its expressive query language is simple for developers to learn and use. Functionality such as automatic failover, horizontal scaling, and the ability to assign data to a location are built-in.

## Restful Apis
A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources.

A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service or REST API -- is based on representational state transfer (REST), which is an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development.

## Express.js
express or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.[3] It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.


# React Js

React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.

Instead, use useEffect. The function passed to useEffect will run after the render is committed to the screen. Think of effects as an escape hatch from React’s purely functional world into the imperative world.

Learn React
People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.
If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our practical tutorial.
If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.
Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.

Unlike componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, the function passed to useEffect fires after layout and paint, during a deferred event. This makes it suitable for the many common side effects, like setting up subscriptions and event handlers, because most types of work shouldn’t block the browser from updating the screen.
